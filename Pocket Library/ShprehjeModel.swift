But then so does ignorance.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.","Every noble work is at first impossible.","Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.","Nobody ever wrote down a plan to be broke, fat, lazy, or stupid. Those things are what happen when you don’t have a plan.","Rule #1 of life. Do what makes YOU happy.","It is not enough to aim, you must hit.","Every strike brings me closer to the next home run","An obstacle is often a stepping stone.","I am not a product of my circumstances.

It’s because of them I’m doing it myself.","We become what we think about."]
